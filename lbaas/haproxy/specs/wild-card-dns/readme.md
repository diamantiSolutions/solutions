# HAProxy setup with wildcard DNS.

***
This example is extension of haproxy/specs/stable example. It will use ingress controller and backends from haproxy/specs/stable example. For this example, we will use wildcard DNS *.cafe.example.com mapped to static endpoint/IP assigned for HAProxy instance.


### 1. setup ingress rules for wild card DNS
Setup cafe-wild-ingress.yaml with correct rules:
```
cat cafe-wild-ingress.yaml
...
spec:
  rules:
  - host: coffee.cafe.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: coffee-svc
          servicePort: 80
  - host: tea.cafe.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: tea-svc
          servicePort: 80
```

### 2. Create new Ingress configuration.
```
$ kubectl create -f cafe-wild-ingress.yaml
```
> please note that as no ingress-class is specified in ingress spec, these rules will be added in addition to rules added by Ingress spec in base example.


### 3.  Test North-south access to ingress controller         
Map wild card DNS entry *.cafe.example.com  to IP of HAproxy. And access *.cafe.example.com with respective subdomain name. Look at the response to make sure you are being served from correct and expected IP backends.
```
  curl http://water.cafe.example.com/ | grep address
  curl http://coffee.cafe.example.com/ | grep address
```




# Termination with wildcard SSL 
****

Following exmaple demonstrate how to setup TLS termination for HAProxy with wildcard DNS.

### 1. Create the wild card DNS entry
```
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout registry.key -x509 -days 365 -out registry.crt
```

### 2. Specify common name as will card.
```
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:*.cafe.example.com
```

### 3. Create wildcard TLS secrete:
```
$ kubectl create secret tls haproxy-wild-tls --cert=/home/diamanti/tls/wild.cafe.example.com/registry.crt --key=/home/diamanti/tls/wild.cafe.example.com/registry.key
```

### 4. Update ingress controller spec to have tls entry for all possible domain.
```
cat cafe-wild-ingress-tls.yaml
...
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
  - tea.cafe.example.com
  - coffee.cafe.example.com
  - water.cafe.example.com
  secretName: haproxy-wild-tls
  rules:
  - host: coffee.cafe.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: coffee-svc
          servicePort: 80
  - host: tea.cafe.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: tea-svc
          servicePort: 80
  - host: water.cafe.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: water-svc
          servicePort: 80
```


### 5. create new modified ingress.
```
$ kubectl delete -f cafe-wild-ingress.yaml 
$ kubectl create -f cafe-wild-ingress-tls.yaml
```

### 6. Access it from outside or inside cluster using curl
```
curl https://tea.cafe.example.com/ -k | grep address
curl https://coffee.cafe.example.com/ -k | grep address
```
> Please note as we are using self signed certificate, curl will complain about the authenticity, so for testing purpose you can run curl with `-k` or `--insecure` option


Please note:
> * TLS setting in ingress spec need to have individual subdomain, wild card *.cafe.exmaple.com does not work
> * This setup will only work for *.cafe.example.com, not for cafe.example.com or *.*.cafe.example.com . If needed we can have different certs for other levels of domain. Another possibility is to have subjectAltName extension enabled for openSSL generation and CA.


***
> you can use run*.sh scripts in this dir to do everything in one step. But be aware that it assumes you donâ€™t have any existing pods running. So its better to run the script first with delete option to cleanup.
```
./run.sh delete
./run.sh
```
